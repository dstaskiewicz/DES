# DES
## Working implementation of Data Encryption Standard
### How to use:
#### Just type in the text to cipher into "input.txt" and run the app 
#### The implementation uses a set of keys generated randomly using Random Number Generator implemented at https://github.com/awilgosiewicz/RNG_Bezp
#### The ciphered text will be saved to "output.txt"
